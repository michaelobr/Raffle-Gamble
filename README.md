# Project Name: Raffle-Gamble

# Description 
This is my first independent project in Python. Even though my ultimate goal is to become a specialist with the NLTK library, this program does not include any usage of NLTK. Instead, this project is designed for the following reasons. 
1) To show my implementation of Python programming to solve real world problems. 
2) To show my thought process. 
3) To show how I can write Python code using the proper style. 

The purpose of this program is to help give me a competitive advantage in an upcoming 50/50 raffle drawing my mother's non-profil organization is having. It will help me decide 3 things.
1) How many tickets I should buy. 
2) What will be my probability of winning. 
3) What my profitability & ROI would be (if any) if I won. 


# CONCLUSION
I discovered that just like its name implies, you can never have => 50% chance to make a profit, you can only have a 50% maximum of breaking even. This is due to the inherent nature of 50/50 raffles, that the hosting party keeps 50% of all ticket sales. Ultimately, I decided to not purchase any tickets at all, and rather my money would be much more wisely spent on a well diversified index fund. 

This project also demonstrates myopic gain/loss aversion fairly well. Many people view a less than a 1% chance of earning more than a thousand percent rate of return much more advantageous than a higher percentage chance of gain with a lower rate of return. Over time, you will only lose money if you continuously participate in 50/50 drawings.
